# YouTube Project:
In this project, I'm working with YouTube dataset to find out what information this dataset gives us. And from that, I will get some insights to help us understand what is going on with comments on YouTube.
This 'YouTube comments' Dataset contains the data of all the trending videos on YouTube in 2017. They are views, likes, dislikes, comments, links, origin... 
In this project, I mostly use Python for analysing the data. Once I get the information that needed, the Power BI will help me show them to target person (my managers or my clients who have demand for informations and insights from this dataset) by a dashboard.
Just take a little look at the Python Notebook file to get the general overview of what I do. I will explain more in by updating this Readme in the future.
Have a nice day!
